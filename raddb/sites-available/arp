#	This is a virtual server that handles ARP.
#
#	It allows the administrator to log ARP packets on the
#	local network.  The idea is that the ARP packets can be
#	checked against a database (e.g. DHCP), or stored in
#	an ARP-specific database.  If something funny is
#	going on, it can produce syslog messages informing the
#	administrator.
#
#	See "arpwatch" for examples of what it should do.   For now,
#	this is just a toy example.
#
#	It NEVER sends an ARP packet.

server arp {
	listen {
		#
		#  ARP is type arp.
		#
		type = arp

		#
		#  The only configuration possible for ARP
		#  is the name of the interface.
		#
		interface = en1
	}


	#
	#  For now, ARP is processed through the "post-auth"
	#  section.  As we make the server more protocol agnostic,
	#  this will change.
	#
	#  If you need to know the interface, use %{listen:interface}
	#
	post-auth {
		ok
